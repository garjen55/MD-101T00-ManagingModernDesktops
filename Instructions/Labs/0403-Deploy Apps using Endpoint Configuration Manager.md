# Practice Lab: Deploy Apps using Endpoint Configuration Manager

## Summary

In this lab, you will use Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to deploy applications to desktop client workstations. 

### Scenario

Contoso uses Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to manage desktop workstations within the on-premises Active Directory network environment. You need to deploy a new application named Microsoft Power BI desktop to the Windows 11 Configuration Manager clients. The Endpoint Configuration Manager administrator has already created the application object for you. Your tasks include creating a collection for the target devices, distributing the application content to distribution points, and then creating the deployment assigned to the target collection. You will verify the process by ensuring that the application is displayed in the Software Center on SEA-CL1.

### Task 1: Create a device collection

1. On **SEA-CFG1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Configuration Manager Console**. The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager console opens.

3. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections**. 

4. Right-click **Device Collections** and then select **Create Device Collection**. The Create Device Collection Wizard opens.

5. On the **General** page, configure the following and then select **Next**:
   - Name: **Power BI App Deployment**
   - Comment: **Devices targeted to install Power BI Desktop**
   - Limiting collection: **All Windows 11 Workstations**

6. On the **Membership Rules** page, select **Next**. At the Configuration Manager warning, select **OK**. You will add a direct member at a later step.

7. On the **Summary** page, select **Next** and then at the **Completion** page, select **Close**. 

   > The **Power BI App Deployment** collection is displayed in the Device Collections list.

### Task 2: Assign a Device to an existing Collection

1. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Devices**. 

   > Take note of the devices listed. Any device that has a green circle with a white checkmark are currently active.

2. In the details pane, select **SEA-CL1**.

3. Right-click **SEA-CL1**, point to **Add Selected Items**, and then select **Add Selected Items to Existing Device Collection**.

4. On the **Select Collection** dialog box, select **Power BI App Deployment**, and then select **OK**.

5. To verify, in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections** and then double-click **Power BI App Deployment**. 

   > SEA-CL1 should be listed as a member of this collection.

### Task 3: Configure a deployment type 

1. In the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager console select the **Software Library** workspace.

2. In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management** and then select **Applications**. 

   > Notice the applications that have been created by the Endpoint Configuration Manager administrator.

3. In the details pane, select **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)**.

4. In the results pane, select the **Deployment Types** tab. Notice that there is one deployment type that is based upon Windows Installer.

5. Right-click the **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64) - Windows installer** deployment type and then select **Properties**.

6. In the **Properties** dialog box, select the **Programs** tab. Take note of how the application is installed. It will use msiexec with the /q switch which performs a quiet installation.

7. In the **Properties** dialog box, select the **Requirements** tab and then select **Add**. 

8. In the **Create Requirement** dialog box, configure the following and then select **OK**:
    - Category: Device
    - Condition: Operating System
    - Rule type: Value
    - Operator: One of Windows 11 (Select the check box next to Windows 11)
9. In the **Properties** dialog box, select **OK**. This requirement will prevent the app from installing on any operating system except Windows 11.

### Task 4: Distribute content to distribution points 

1. In the **Software Library** workspace, select **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)**.

2. Right-click **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)** and then select **Distribute Content**.

3. On the **General** page, select **Next**.

4. On the **Content** page, select **Next**.

5. On the **Content Destination** page, select **Add** and then select **Distribution Point**.

6. On the **Add Distribution Points** dialog box, select the check box next to **SEA-CFG1.CONTOSO.COM**, and then select **OK**.

7. On the **Content Destination** page, select **Next**.

8. On the **Summary** page, select **Next** and then select **Close**.

9. In the **Summary** tab, select **Content Status**. 

   > The Content Status page opens for Microsoft Power BI Desktop. In the results pane, verify that a green circle is displayed and that Success:1 displays next to the circle. This indicates that the content is now distributed to the distribution points and can now be deployed to devices. You may need to select the Refresh button in the ribbon.

10. In the top left corner select the **Back to Applications** arrow to return to the Software Library Applications node.

### Task 5: Create a deployment

1. In the **Software Library** workspace, select **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)**.

2. Right-click **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)** and then select **Deploy**. The **Deploy Software Wizard** opens.

3. On the **General** page, next to **Collection**, select **Browse**.

4. On the **Select Collection** page, select **User Collections** and then select **Device Collections**.

5. In the **Device Collections** list, select **Power BI App Deployment** and then select **OK**.

6. On the **General** page, select **Next**.

7. On the **Content** page, select **Next**. 

8. On the **Deployment Settings** page, verify that the **Action** is set to **Install** and the **Purpose** is set to **Available**. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Scheduling** page, select **Next**. The application will be available as soon as possible by default.

10. On the **User Experience** page, next to **User notifications**, select **Display in Software Center and show all notifications**. Select **Next**.


11. On the **Alerts** page, select **Next**.

12. On the **Summary** page, select **Next** and then select **Close**. 

13. In the results pane, on the **Deployments** tab, verify that the deployment displays.

14. Close the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager console.

15. Sign out of SEA-CFG1.

### Task 6: Use Software center to install a deployed app

1. Switch to SEA-CL1, and sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Click **Start** and then enter **Control Panel**.

3. In the results, select **Control Panel**.

4. In the **Control panel**, select **System and Security**.

5. In **System and Security**, select **Configuration Manager**. Configuration Manager Properties is displayed.

6. In the **Configuration Manager Properties** dialog box, select the **Actions** tab.

7. On the **Actions** tab, select **Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle**, and then select **Run Now**. At the message prompt, select **OK**.

8. Select **OK** to close the **Configuration Manager Properties**, and then close **Control Panel**. 

9. In the notification area, select **New Software is Available** and then select **Open Software Center**. You might need to expand the notification area arrow to display the icon. If **New Software is Available** does not appear in the notification area, then search for **Software Center** and run it.

10. In the **Software Center**, on the **Applications** page, notice the new application available named **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)**. This application is now available to any device that is a member of the **Power BI App Deployment** collection created previously.

11. Select **Microsoft Power BI Desktop (x64)** and then select **Install**. 

    > The application downloads and installs without user input. You will know that the install was successful when the **Power BI Desktop** shortcut displays on the desktop.

12. Close Software Center.

13. Sign out of SEA-CL1.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to deploy applications to desktop client workstations.
